“This wasn’t a very well thought out bargain,” you say, interrupting the devil’s cackling.

“What do you mean?” says the devil.

“A good devil’s bargain should leave the victim worse off than before the bargain,” you say.

“Well,” frowns the devil, “if you think you can do better, why don’t you do my job for me.”

To become the new devil, turn to Entry 25.

“Hello,” says a prerecorded voice in strained English. “Today, I am having lavish dinner party. If you hear this, you are invited. Come to 7 Vimpare Avenue.”

Everything in front of you is vaporized instantly. All of the traffic is gone and downtown is in ruins. Looks like your workplace has been obliterated as well.

“There you go!” cackles the devil. “Now there is no traffic at all!”

You get that this is supposed to be a wish-gone-wrong kind of thing that teaches you not to sell your soul for little things but now you don’t have to go to work today so you’re not too hung up about it.

You drive over to 7 Vimpare Avenue. An enormous castle stretches off into the sky, despite being built next to some pretty ordinary-looking suburban homes. That must have really hurt their property value.

A bulky man dressed in black is waiting by the door. “You must be our visitor,” says the man. He steps to the side and ushers you in. “The Count is eager,” he says, “to have you for dinner.”

To walk in to the castle, go to Entry 24.

You finally get to work and take a seat in your cubicle. Your boss comes over to check on you.

“You are late,” he says stiffly. It’s as if he’s struggling to pronounce his words. “I expect you to work overtime.”

You notice an odd blankness in his eyes.

To apologize and agree to work overtime, go to Entry 9.

As you type away at your computer, a strange feeling of nausea washes over you. Unseen hands clasp around your very soul, pulling it slowly into the computer monitor.

You pry yourself away just in time to stop your soul from being stolen.

“Hey!” you say to your boss, “I think the computer just tried to suck out my soul!”

“Oh,” says your boss dully, sipping a coffee, “it hasn’t done that to you yet? Pretty much everyone in this office has had their soul sucked out by now.”

You look around in horror and realize everyone’s been turned into a soulless husk of who they once were – well, you know, more so.

They’re all tapping away at their computers, eyes blank, minds blank, drool coming off their mouths – okay, yeah, they did that before, but this time you assume it’s because their souls have been stolen.

“It’s not so bad, really,” says your boss. “I’m pretty much the same as before, I’m just not as passionate about golf.”

“Can… can I keep my soul? “ you ask.

Your boss shrugs. “I mean, if you keep up with the workload I guess.”

To start unplugging the soul-sucking computers, go to Entry 11.

To keep working, go to Entry 13.

You unplug computer after computer. As you do, you see souls fly from the monitor straight back into the bodies of your co-workers.

Before you can unplug another, you hear something coming down the hall. It’s the human resource lady, Janet. She’s become an enormous, screeching monstrosity — again, an argument could be made that she was one before but now she looks the part, slime oozing out of her terrifying figure. She’s slithering down the hall, souls rushing from all around you into her mouth.

To give a rousing speech in an attempt to turn everyone against Janet, go to Entry 19.

You get in your car and head into bumper-to-bumper traffic. Ugh. At this rate, you’ll never get to work!

A horned man in a dirty red suit is strolling past cars on the highway. He taps on your window.

“Hey!” he says, “late for work? Let’s make a deal.”

From his suit pocket he pulls out a burned scrap of paper. There’s a star-shaped symbol written in blood on it.

“Sign here,” he says, pointing to the pentagram, “and this little problem will be… remedied.”

He takes a pen out of his pocket.

If you want to sign the paper, go to Entry 6.

If you want to ignore him and wait for traffic to move along, go to Entry 8.

You plunge the chair leg deep within Count Notavampire’s heart. The man screams and dies as blood squirts out of his heart. The butler gasps in horror.

“What did you do?!” he yells.

“What do you mean?” you say, “the guy was clearly a vampire.”

“No he wasn’t!” says the butler, “did you think he was a vampire just because he had a Transylvanian accent?!”

“Of course not!” you say, not wanting to admit that you thought he was a vampire just because he had a Transylvanian accent.

“He specifically changed his last name to Notavampire because everyone thought he was a vampire!” yells the butler. You realize you just murdered a man and also maybe committed a hate crime.

You’re sentenced to life in prison.

Everyone you saved is still confused, looking aimlessly into their blank computers. You decide that means it’s time for a rousing speech.

“Everyone!” you yell, “don’t you see what’s happening here? This passionless existence, it has turned against us! None of us liked our jobs before—”

“I like my job!” says one of your co-workers.

“Shh,” you say.

“Yeah, I like my job too,” says another. “Seems like you’re projecting.”

“It literally sucked the soul out of your body!” you fire back.

“It really wasn’t that bad!” they say. “We were getting a lot more work done!”

“Don’t you see?” laughs Janet. “This is the way it must be. For the sake of productivity.”

“Hold on!” you say. “If everyone’s working at full capacity, and everyone’s a soulless drone that does exactly what they’re told, then why do we need human resources?”

Janet thinks about it for a moment.

“Actually,” says your boss, stumbling out of his cubicle, “you raise a good point. Janet, you’re fired.”

“NoooOOOoooOOO!” screeches Janet, collapsing into a pile of paperwork. As she does, everyone’s soul flies out of her and returns to their owners’ body.

Everyone seems momentarily dazed and then returns back to work as if nothing happened. From that point on life is pretty much the same, except sometimes at the water cooler people will bring up that one time Janet turned into an abomination that stole everyone’s souls. Then everyone laughs, shuffles their feet awkwardly, and goes about their day.

The End.

“No way!” you say in a sudden and liberating act of defiance, “I quit!”

“Oh,” says your boss. “I mean… okay.”

You’re a little disappointed. “…okay?”

“Yeah,” shrugs your boss, fatigued. He shuffles over to his office, trips over his feet and just lies on the floor. A little weird, but not your problem.

You run outside and take a breath of sweet, clean air. You’re finally free of that dead-end job!

Dinner with Count Notavampire is quite pleasant and by time he starts digging into the roasted garlic you get the feeling that he’s probably not a vampire.

“Ah!” he says, wiping his mouth with a napkin, “it’s been so long since I have had good meal with company! You are the first person to come to my parties in years!”

You see now that all your paranoia was based on cruelly exaggerated Transylvanian stereotypes. “I guess all Transylvanians aren’t vampires after all,” you say, glad that you learned this important social lesson.

“Transylvania?” says Count Notavampire, “I am from Greece! Everybody in this country treats me with such hostility, they think I am a vampire! Changing my name, it did not even help!”

“Why not go back to Greece?” you ask.

“I wish I could!” says the Count, throwing his hands up, “but I would need donation, so that I could buy property there.”

You decide to give Count Notavampire nine dollars — just enough to afford a downpayment on some property in Greece. He is so grateful to you that he leaves you his entire castle and butler.

All because you educated yourself about the dangers of stereotyping.

You walk into the castle. A gaunt man wearing a red cape slowly descends an elegant flight of stairs. “Greetings,” he says in a thick Transylvanian accent. “My name is Count Notavampire.”

He gestures to the butler behind him. “Please, escort our guest to their seat.”

The intimidating man is blocking your exit. Seems you have no choice.

The butler guides you and Count Notavampire to a luxurious table filled with all kinds of food. The butler pours red liquid into a wine glass next to you.

As the count dishes himself some garlic mashed potatoes you start to look for a way of this dire situation. You notice that the chair you’re sitting on has a pointed leg that might work as a makeshift wooden stake.

“Yeah, alright,” you say, becoming the devil because that’s how it works.

As it turns out you didn’t take the job of the devil but just a devil so you’re relegated to middle-management position where you don’t get to inflict as much pain and misery as you had dreamed. There’s no question you are causing agony through your facilitation of demonic reign across the realm of mortals, but it’s not something you can explain easily around the dinner table. It’s like, alright Mom, I may not be going out and actually stabbing people with my red pitchfork but I’m doing my part to make the world a more depraved place and that’s something I can be proud of.

She’ll get it one day.
